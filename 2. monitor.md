# CloudTrail 1

- Is an AWS service that records actions in AWS that were taken by any user, role or service.
- Events types:
	- Management events = control plane events.
	- Data events = data plane events. Supported on few services only (S3, Lambda).
	- Insights = unusual activity in your AWS account.
- Events history:
	- You can view, search, and download the past 90 days of activity in your AWS account.
- CloudTrail trails:
	- A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events to an Amazon S3 bucket, CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Events.


---

# CloudTrail 2

- Events delivery time:
	- Logs are delivered within an average of about 15 minutes of an API call. No SLA.
	- Events are delivered to the CloudWatch Events bus in near-realtime.
- Delivering log files to S3:
	- Log files are compressed JSON files.
- A trail can be applied to all Regions or a single Region.
- To create an alarm on some API activity, you should create a trail that sends the events to CloudWatch Logs and create an alarm in CloudWatch Logs.

---

# CloudWatch 1

- Monitors AWS resources and your applications in real time to collect and track metrics. 
- CloudWatch concepts: Namespaces, Metrics, Dimensions, Statistics, Percentiles, Alarms.
- Namespace:
	- A container for CloudWatch metrics. Example: "AWS/EC2".
- Metric:
  - A time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. 
- Dimension:
  - A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric.
	- For example, you can get statistics for a specific EC2 instance by specifying the InstanceId dimension when you search for metrics. 

---

# CloudWatch 2
- Statistics:
	- Statistics are metric data aggregations over specified periods of time. 
	- Example of statistics functions: min, max, average, sum, percentile.
- Percentile:
	- A percentile indicates the relative standing of a value in a dataset.
	- For example, the 95th percentile means that 95 percent of the data is lower than this value and 5 percent of the data is higher than this value. 
- Alarm:
	- Automatically initiate actions on your behalf. 
- Action:
  - An action can be triggered either when:
		- the alarm goes to an "In-Alarm" state, or
		- the alarm goes to an "OK" state, or,
		- the alarm goes to an "Insufficient data" state.
- CloudWatch agent: enables you to collect internal system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances and on-prem servers across operating systems.

# CloudWatch Logs 1

- Collects and monitors log files from sources like EC2, CloudTrail and Route53.
- Logs can be viewed, searched, filtered and archived.
- A log event is a record of some activity. Composed of a timestamp and a raw message.
- A log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source. 
- Log groups define groups of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings.
- Metrics from logs:
	- You can search and filter the log data coming into CloudWatch Logs and create one or more metric filters.

---
# CloudWatch Logs 2
- Subscriptions:
  - You can use subscriptions to stream log events from CloudWatch Logs to other services such as Kinesis stream, Kinesis Data Firehose stream, or AWS Lambda for custom processing, analysis, or loading to other systems. 

---
# CloudWatch Logs Insights:

- Enables you to search and analyze your log data in CloudWatch Logs.
- Includes a purpose-built query language.
- Automatically discovers fields in logs from many AWS services and from 3rd party JSON logs.

---

# CloudWatch Events 1
- Delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources.
- CloudWatch Event is based on one special event stream included in EventBridge for AWS system events.

- Events can be triggered in CloudWatch Events when:
	- A change happens in your AWS environment. For example, EC2 generates an event when the state of an EC2 instance changes from pending to running.
	- You make API calls. These events are published by CloudTrail. 
	- You can generate custom application-level events and publish them to CloudWatch Events. 
	- You set up scheduled events that are generated on a periodic basis.

---

# CloudWatch Events 2

- Rules:
	- A rule matches incoming events and routes them to targets for processing.
	- A single rule can route to multiple targets, all of which are processed in parallel.
	- A rule can customize the JSON sent to the target, by passing only certain parts or by overwriting it with a constant.
- Targets:
	- A target processes events. 
	- Targets can include EC2 instances, Lambda functions, Kinesis streams, ECS tasks, Step Functions state machines, SNS topics, SQS queues, and built-in targets.
	- A target receives events in JSON format. 
- Event Patterns
	- Rules use event patterns to select events and route them to targets.

---

# AWS X-Ray
- A service that collects data about requests that your application serves.

---

# AWS Config
- Enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. 
- You can review the changes history of your configurations.
- AWS Config can monitor your configurations with the following workflow: Triggers ==> Rules ==> Notification ==> Remediation.


---

# Trusted Advisor

- Inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations on:
	- **Cost optimization**. Examples:
		- EC2 Reserved Instances optimization.
		- Low utilization Amazon EC2 instances.
	- **Fault Tolerance**. Examples:
		- EBS snapshots.
		- EC2 availability zone balance.
	- **Performance**. Examples:
		- High utilization of EC2 CPU or EBS IOPS.
	- **Security**. Examples:
		- Security groups - Unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0).
	- **Service Limits**: Checks whether your account approaches or exceeds the limits (quotas) for AWS services and resources.

# AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD)

- Provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you.
