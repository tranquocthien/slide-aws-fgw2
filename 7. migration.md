# The 7 Rs of application migration:

- Rehost (lift and shift): Move an application to the cloud without making any changes: from a VM/Server to an EC2 instance.
- Relocate (hypervisor-level lift and shift): This migration scenario is specific to VMware Cloud on AWS, which supports VM workload portability between your on-premises environment and AWS.
- Replatform (lift and reshape): Move an application to the cloud by taking advantage of cloud capabilities like PaaS. For example, migrate your on-premises Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle.
- Refactor (re-architect) – Move an application and modify its architecture by taking full advantage of cloud-native features to improve agility, performance, and scalability.
- Repurchase (drop and shop) – Change to a different product, typically by moving from a traditional application to a software as a service (SaaS) product.
- Retain (revisit) – Keep applications in your source environment, at least temporarily.
- Retire – Decommission or remove applications that are no longer needed in your source environment.
